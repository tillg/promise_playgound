# Promises

I hate them, should love them. So let's play with them...

## github followers

Make a promise that retrieves the github followers of an account. Then per follower one promise that retrieves all the followers of every follower and so on.

* Chaining promises programatically
* Have promises that run in parallel and understand in what order (can we understand this??)

## Tech notes

I use and run this with the following setup:

* `node --version` v7.10.1
* `npm --version` 4.2.0
